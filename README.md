This is the 'target' for the grading scripts for CS3005 at Utah Tech University.

If you stumble upon this, please don't mess with it. 

The Big Idea

Each student has a workflow yml that refers to this script. that workflow was included 
in their starter project and it is difficult for me to update it. but I want to regularly
add new 'assignments' to the grading script. since their repos all just call this one
centralized repo, I can update this and it automatically, immediately changes what 
grading actions work for them.
